Find the agents with a number of incidents assigned less than or equal to the mode (most frequent) of the number of assigned incidents across agents. For example, if you were asked to find the 'mean' or 'average' for a case where there are 4 agents assigned 1,2,3,2 incidents respectively, the mean would be 2.
